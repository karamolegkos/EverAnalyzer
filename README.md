# EverAnalyzer
EverAnalyzer is a platform that I build as my Bachelor Thesis in the Department of Digital Systems at the University of Piraeus. EverAnalyzer provides a solution by which an analyst can manage processes using Spark or Hadoop but also assists the end-users on their decision on the use of the above tools. Having this feature, it makes it easy for any analyst who wants to perform data analysis work on these two frameworks. Ultimately, the platform is a useful tool for any data analyst that aims to use and export results through Spark and Hadoop.
